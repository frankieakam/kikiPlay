## KikiPlay - A Game Store Website

KikiPlay is an interactive, user-friendly game store website that was developed as part of my individual project for web development defense. 
This website showcases a variety of games, allowing users to explore, browse, and purchase their favorite games, all while providing a seamless shopping experience. 
The project incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies to create a fully responsive and dynamic platform.

## Features
- Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Game Listings: View a variety of games with images, titles, and descriptions.
- Game Filters: Easy navigation and filtering options for users to browse games based on categories.
- Interactive UI: JavaScript-driven interactions, such as theme toggles and dynamic content updates.
- Shopping Experience: Integration of basic shopping features, including product views and add-to-cart functionality 
  (without actual payment processing as the backend is not implemented).
- External Links: The project includes absolute links to external platforms like EA Sports and PlayStation for users to explore more about featured games and content.

## Technologies Used
HTML: Structured content and markup for the web pages.
CSS: Styling and layout management, ensuring a visually appealing design.
JavaScript: Dynamic features like the theme toggle, interactive UI elements, and other functionalities.
Git: Version control to manage project files and track changes.
GitHub: Hosting the project and enabling collaboration.
